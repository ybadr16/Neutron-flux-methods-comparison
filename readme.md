## Comparison between solutions obtained using manual analysis and them montecarlo method

The analytical solution is obtained by solving the diffusion equation for cylindrical geometry, the montecarlo simulation assumes only scattering and absorbtion reactions to mimic
the effect of the diffusion equation.
The analytical solution is found to be:
$$ \phi_{\text{analytical}} = \frac{{\text{So}}}{{2 \pi D}} \left( k_0\left(\frac{r}{L}\right) - \frac{{i_0\left(\frac{r}{L}\right) k_0\left(\frac{a}{L}\right)}}{{i_0\left(\frac{a}{L}\right)}} \right) $$
